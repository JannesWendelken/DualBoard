## Overview

I came up with the idea for **DualBoard** when I was looking for a small 2-key keyboard for Geometry Dash, but the prices were just way too high. So, I decided to design my own! This project lets you create your very own custom macroboard for a fraction of the cost of pre-built options.

## Features

- **Budget-friendly:** Designed to keep costs low.
- **Compact:** Small, portable design.
- **Customizable:** Modify the design to fit your needs.
- **Based on ATtiny85:** A small but powerful microcontroller that’s perfect for this kind of project.

## How to Build

Here’s a quick guide to get you started with building your own **DualBoard**:

1. **Order the PCB:**  
   You can use services like JLCPCB or any other PCB manufacturer to get your custom PCB made.
   
2. **Program the ATtiny85:**  
   Use the Arduino IDE to program the ATtiny85. You’ll find all the necessary code in the repository.

3. **Solder the Components:**  
   Solder the components onto the PCB. You’ll need basic soldering skills, and I recommend using the 0603 package for components to keep things compact and affordable.

4. **Print or Buy a Case:**  
   You can 3D print the case (I have a design for you), or purchase one online. The case will help protect the components and give the board a nice finish.

5. **Assemble the Board:**  
   Once everything is soldered and the case is ready, assemble the board, plug it in, and you're done!

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

Here’s the list of components you’ll need:

- **2x 1k Resistors**  
- **2x 68Ω Resistors**  
- **1x 4.7µF Capacitor**  
- **1x ATtiny85**  
- **1x USB Micro-B Connector**  
- **1x LED**  

**Note:**  
I used 0603 package components to keep the project cost-effective. However, if you’re not comfortable with hand-soldering small parts, feel free to change the component sizes to something more manageable.
